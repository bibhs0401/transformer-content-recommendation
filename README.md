# Automated Content Recommendation with Transformer Embeddings  

## 📌 Overview  
This project implements an **automated content recommendation system** using **transformer-based embeddings**. The goal is to use modern **NLP architectures** (e.g., BERT/Sentence Transformers) to generate meaningful text representations and provide **personalized content recommendations**.  

By combining **deep learning**, **embedding similarity**, and **content retrieval techniques**, this project demonstrates how transformer models can be applied to real-world recommendation tasks.

## ✨ Key Features  
- Utilizes **pretrained transformer embeddings** (Sentence-BERT, Hugging Face models).  
- Implements **semantic similarity** for personalized recommendations.  
- Includes **data preprocessing, feature engineering, and evaluation** pipelines.  
- Demonstrates the practical use of **NLP in recommender systems**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries**: PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Approach**: Transformer embeddings + cosine similarity for recommendation

## 📊 Methodology  

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Cleaned and tokenized text data.  
   - Removed stopwords, punctuation, and normalized text.  

2. **Embedding Generation**  
   ```python
   from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
   
   model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
   embeddings = model.encode(text_data, show_progress_bar=True)
    ```
3. **Similarity Computation**

  ```
  from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

  similarity_matrix = cosine_similarity(embeddings)
  ```

4. **Recommendation Retrieval**
   ```
   def recommend(content_index, top_n=5):
    sim_scores = list(enumerate(similarity_matrix[content_index]))
    sim_scores = sorted(sim_scores, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    return [idx for idx, score in sim_scores[1:top_n+1]]
   ```

## 📈 Results

Generated context-aware recommendations that captured semantic similarity.

Example: an article about “Neural Networks in Healthcare” recommended related content on “Deep Learning for Medical Imaging” and “AI in Diagnostics”.

Plots such as embedding visualizations and similarity heatmaps demonstrated how transformers capture semantic meaning.
